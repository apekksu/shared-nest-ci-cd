### `Shared NestJS CI/CD pipeline`
This repository provides a shared CI/CD pipeline for deploying NestJS applications to an EC2 instance, using a RDS Mysql instance.


### `Getting Started`
To use the shared CI/CD pipeline, follow these steps:

Create or clone your NestJS application repository.
Set up the correct directory structure:
    **.github/workflows/deploy.yml** with referance to this shared pipeline as shown in the example
    source files located in **/src** (**main.ts**, app-module etc.)
Commit and push to the branch mentioned in your yaml for automatic deployment.

```yaml
name: Deploy NestJS app

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - prod

jobs:
  set-params-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Check branch and set inputs
        id: set-vars
        run: |
          echo "Branch name: ${{ github.ref_name }}"
          if [ "${{ github.ref_name }}" = "prod" ]; then
            echo "s3_bucket=apekksu-cyberfolk-prod-euc1" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
            echo "secret_name=cyberfolk-prod" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
            echo "application_port=3005" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          else
            echo "s3_bucket=apekksu-cyberfolk-dev-euc1" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
            echo "secret_name=cyberfolk-dev" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
            echo "application_port=3000" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

      - name: Call shared pipeline
        uses: apekksu/shared-nest-ci-cd/.github/workflows/ci.yml@main
        with:
          s3-bucket-name: ${{ steps.set-vars.outputs.s3_bucket }}
          application-name: ${{ github.event.repository.name }}
          application-port: ${{ steps.set-vars.outputs.application_port }}  
          aws-region: eu-central-1
          ec2-app-tag: shared-nest-ci-cd # or shared-nest-ci-cd-for-ai 
          secret-name: ${{ steps.set-vars.outputs.secret_name }}
        secrets:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
```

### `Simnplified version without environment option`

```yaml
name: Deploy NestJS App

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    uses: apekksu/shared-nest-ci-cd/.github/workflows/ci.yml@main
    with:
      s3-bucket-name: apekksu-cyberfolk-dev-euc1
      application-name: ${{ github.event.repository.name }}
      application-port: 3000
      aws-region: eu-central-1
      secret-name: cyberfolk-dev
      ec2-app-tag: shared-nest-ci-cd # or shared-nest-ci-cd-for-ai 
    secrets:
      aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
      aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}

```

### `Using organizaion level secrets`
**AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID**: The AWS access key ID.
**AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY**: The AWS secret access key.
**secret-name: cyberfolk-dev**: Name of the secret stored in AWS Secrets Manager

Secrets above are required for the pipeline to authenticate with AWS and are set on organization level secrets. Ask Tigran/Aram to check if there are issues with credentials.


### `Shared pipeline performs the following tasks:`

The pipeline checks out your repository, installs dependencies, and builds the application.
The built application is zipped and uploaded to an S3 bucket.
The pipeline retrieves the shared EC2 instance information and deploys the application using AWS SSM.


### `Example Repo`
[Authentication Module](https://github.com/apekksu/cyber-folk-be).

Application name uses port number to easily differenciate between pm2 apps.
Use different application ports for multiple applications deployed on the same EC2 instance to avoid port conflicts.
